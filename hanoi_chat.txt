[2022-12-21, 09:13:00] Stew Donkeys: Out for all dates
[2022-12-21, 09:14:55] Mathew Russell: I can’t see older messages but if it’s all sundays I’d likely be in for all of them
[2022-12-21, 09:16:01] ~ Allan: it is every Sunday, this poll is just for the New Years weekend to make sure there is enough interest to warrant renting the court
[2022-12-21, 09:16:26] Evan Donkeys: Since the next two Sundays are Christmas and new years day we are seeing if we can get enough ppl on the Mondays after (26th and 2nd), let us know if you're keen
[2022-12-21, 09:17:03] Mathew Russell: Yeah I’m in for both

[2022-12-21, 09:45:41] ~ Erin Schneckenberger: Schneck X3 are good for either date. Preferably 26/12 though
[2022-12-21, 10:05:21] Pat Donkeys: We're hoping to play both weeks - on the 26th if we get enough and then again on the 1st or 2nd
[2022-12-21, 10:08:38] ~ Erin Schneckenberger: Sorry, misread the calendar, schnecks are only available on 26/12.
[2022-12-21, 11:00:32] Pat Donkeys: We currently have 10 for the 26 and Michael is a maybe with +1 or +2
[2022-12-21, 15:36:07] ~ Do Viet Anh: Im out for both days
[2022-12-21, 20:11:17] Steve Donkeys: Merry Christmas and Happy New year everybody. Sorry can't make hockey these next weeks. We have my wifes family here.

[2022-12-22, 17:00:22] ~ Allan: yeah, wonder where they got it. Did you see the comments, a couple Czech / Slovak guys saying they will need to train us lol
[2022-12-22, 17:06:34] Mathew Russell: 🇨🇦
[2022-12-22, 17:09:08] ~ John: I had hellava comeback, but decided not to respond. Maybe another Donkey can bait ‘em in.
[2022-12-22, 18:17:28] ~ Bender 👺: Sick logo! Hopefully we will see the sport grow in Vietnam the next year and beyond. In the meantime, I’ll be sharpening my skills in the grueling cold of Edmonton.
[2022-12-22, 18:17:53] ~ Jack: Give us the experience of the Battle of Alberta sometime!
[2022-12-22, 18:19:18] ~ Bender 👺: Also, according to my calculations, I’ll be back in Vietnam from June to July. Don’t know if anyone would still be willing to go to ball in the heat of summer tbh.
[2022-12-22, 19:17:03] Pat Donkeys: *Court booked for 26th and 2nd*
[2022-12-22, 19:30:37] Evan Donkeys: I say we play red vs green on Monday 🎄
[2022-12-22, 19:31:09] Mathew Russell: Just checking, all I need to come play is shoes?
[2022-12-22, 19:31:42] Evan Donkeys: Yep, we've got plenty of sticks and some extra pairs of gloves
[2022-12-22, 19:32:05] Mathew Russell: Cool, I shoulda looked it up before I came and I could have packed some gloves and stuff
[2022-12-22, 19:32:31] Evan Donkeys: (strongly) Recommended to wear eye protection, if you can't find something let us know and someone can bring an extra set of glasses or something
[2022-12-22, 19:33:20] Evan Donkeys: Also most guys wear some form of shins, but most just wear those small soccer shin pads which can be found widely and cheaply here
[2022-12-22, 19:40:02] Evan Donkeys: Or ugly Xmas sweater game haha
[2022-12-22, 19:40:34] Mathew Russell: Cool maybe could someone bring extra and I’ll get an idea of what to buy. Also will get shin pads, maybe not by the first game

[2022-12-22, 20:46:29] Mathew Russell: Couple non hockey questions, just moved into a new apartment.  Need bedding (duvet, pillows, towels).  Where’s the best place to buy that kinda stuff?
[2022-12-22, 20:47:08] ~ Allan: Regular time, 18:00-20:00
[2022-12-22, 20:47:15] ~ Marc: Go to Senda

[2022-12-23, 17:47:17] ~ Allan: Ok, was this put down last week? The other red tape was approved by Khanh when I bought it
[2022-12-23, 17:48:56] Evan Donkeys: I remade the other in the yellow tape last week
[2022-12-23, 17:49:12] Evan Donkeys: So there isn't any new red tape
[2022-12-23, 18:05:43] ~ Darren R: Definitely some sort of metaphor in this
[2022-12-23, 18:30:10] Evan Donkeys: It's Hanoi so there's always red tape somewhere haha
[2022-12-23, 18:31:04] ~ Darren R: Yeah, holler when you’ve gotten rid of it all
[2022-12-23, 18:34:03] Evan Donkeys: It's hard to remove ;)

[2022-12-26, 11:50:40] Mathew Russell: Yea what time? 6?  I’ll need to use whatever spare equipment there is
[2022-12-26, 12:00:45] Pat Donkeys: @17052797624 6pm yeah. We have a bunch of spare sticks + a few sets of gloves and shins so no worries

[2022-12-26, 16:34:58] Pat Donkeys: We do need another goalie, excellent Tommy!
[2022-12-26, 16:36:38] Pat Donkeys: @17169510899 he could probably bring his own shoulder pads if he has any, that's the one piece I see could being a little big on him...
[2022-12-26, 16:36:59] ~ Allan: There are the old white pads there
[2022-12-26, 16:37:10] ~ Allan: They will fit, just lead to bruises 😜

This is a volunteer job and the last thing I want to do is spend any additional time chasing down money and stuff like that. As a friendly reminder we don’t take bank transfer this is a cash only operation, so bring your 200K it really shouldn’t be that hard.

[2023-01-05, 12:35:14] Mathew Russell: Yeah I’m realizing that when I drive by and think it’s a different one than I was in

[2023-01-06, 14:02:18] Evan Donkeys: How are the legs kubs? You want 2 subs each team or two big teams of 9 with 4-5 subs
[2023-01-06, 14:02:54] ~ Jakub: Let’s are good! 3 teams 3 hours would be the dream scenario, at least for me !

[2023-01-07, 11:58:02] Alex Barzdenis: Would it be worth considering permanent Mondays if everyone's available? Kind of sucks taking Sunday's off work just to get booted for an event every few weeks
[2023-01-07, 12:01:29] Pat Donkeys: I was thinking the same thing
[2023-01-07, 12:06:36] Mathew Russell: I’m a maybe, monday is the gf’s 30th

[2023-01-07, 12:19:33] ~ Darren R: We’ve had this convo before so I’m happy to go with the will of the group, as a part-time part-timer obviously don’t work around me. Sounds like an opportunity for a poll eh Board peeps?
[2023-01-07, 12:30:21] ~ Allan: It is something we can investigate, we did check before and decided to stay on Sunday. With losing days there is more incentive to move though

[2023-02-19, 15:01:59] Jeremy Thiessen: He’s a good guy…..🙃
[2023-02-20, 11:42:51] ~ Allan: first - I am working on footage, there is so much it will take a while so please be patient 🥴

second, let's make this tournament happen - I think Hanoi can easily field 2 teams and maybe the rest of Vietnam could combine for a 3rd. If we get one more international team that is enough for a tournament, ideally we field 6 teams.

Since this is our tournament - I want to get a vote to get ideas on dates that work. It would have to be a Friday / Saturday format to allow for travel, though one possible weekend is the end of April which is a 4 day long weekend here!

Please vote all possible dates in the coming poll, and we will work to secure Xuan La and start the ball rolling!

[2023-02-20, 11:50:28] ~ ✌️: I personally think that the 4 day weekend should be utilized

[2023-02-20, 11:50:58] ~ Allan: would be nice, but only for Vietnam teams

[2023-02-24, 21:17:04] Mathew Russell: I didn’t even notice my rib haha until sleeping
[2023-02-24, 21:29:35] Pat Donkeys: Cracked a rib once playing hockey and had no pain until midway into the night... it was brutal in the morning and lasted for well over a week. You have to be careful if you play Mat, definitely don't want another on that side
[2023-02-24, 21:31:21] Pat Donkeys: Another hit*
[2023-02-24, 21:32:22] Evan Donkeys: My shoulder was hurting on Friday morning from sleeping on it weird then played the whole tourney and I think in the final I got knocked in the back hard in one of the battles
[2023-02-24, 21:32:42] Evan Donkeys: Think that play was the one that sent it from playable to painful
[2023-02-24, 21:33:50] Evan Donkeys: Won the battle though 💪
[2023-02-25, 13:30:30] Pat Donkeys: Hope you were cheering for the Avs @84946415708

[2023-02-25, 17:01:38] Michael Harder Donkeys: 9. I’ll play.
[2023-02-25, 17:07:56] Pat Donkeys: I'm 60-70% in
[2023-02-25, 17:16:41] Mathew Russell: I’m out. Ribs aren’t good
[2023-02-25, 17:17:47] Stew Donkeys: I'm leaning out. My foot is just starting to feel better
[2023-02-25, 17:43:36] Jeremy Thiessen: Bump
[2023-02-26, 08:23:18] ~ Jack: I have been battling a cold for the past week, i’ll likely be out this weekend, otherwise.
[2023-02-26, 08:50:31] ~ Allan: Guys, anyone else coming? @17169510899 @84915088273 if not maybe we take a week off, too many walking wounded
[2023-02-26, 08:51:11] ~ Tommy Schneckenberger: I’ll be there
[2023-02-26, 08:53:34] ~ Allan: Forgot to vote for myself lol

[2023-02-26, 09:55:57] Pat Donkeys: I'm out as well
[2023-02-26, 09:57:21] ~ Jack: I’m calling out as well, i’m going to need to deal with the cold I have this weekend, considering UNIS has some big cold going on.
[2023-02-26, 09:58:01] Pat Donkeys: I have the stick bag at my place, if you guys play we'll need to sort that out
[2023-02-26, 10:33:24] ~ Allan: Guys, I am thinking with the low numbers and the stick issue, not really worth booking the court, let's pick up next week ok
[2023-02-26, 10:37:00] Michael Harder Donkeys: Sure!
[2023-02-26, 10:47:34] Jeremy Thiessen: Yeah guys get healthy again 👉
[2023-02-26, 10:49:53] ~ Jack: Sounds like a plan!
[2023-02-26, 11:11:28] Joe Donkeys: Cancelling sucks, but I agree. Let's be back at it 💯 next week.
[2023-02-26, 11:32:24] ~ Allan: Sucks but will give me some more time to finish editing

[2023-03-10, 09:05:32] Evan Donkeys: What other days of the week are available?
[2023-03-10, 09:09:22] Evan Donkeys: We should just book every available night for the whole month
[2023-03-10, 09:09:36] Evan Donkeys: Then let them know if we'll be there or not 2 days before
[2023-03-10, 09:14:22] Evan Donkeys: Wasn't joking though
[2023-03-10, 09:36:25] ~ Vinh: I'm not saying this isn't Xuân Lá's fault (at least partly) but it's because of an international badminton tournament by the Hanoi Department of Culture and Sports, and they could very well have dumped this on them last minute as well. Still sucks, I know.
[2023-03-10, 09:37:38] Evan Donkeys: All the more reason we need to find a new court, we'll always be an after thought if we're dealing with Khanh who isn't actually the decision maker
[2023-03-10, 09:40:23] ~ Vinh: Not sure you'll find a place where this can't happen, especially in a location that TayHoles are willing to drive to.
[2023-03-10, 09:42:44] Evan Donkeys: Just happening less would be a win

[2023-03-10, 12:08:21] Alex Barzdenis: Can we just book the next 3 Mondays until it's available again?
[2023-03-10, 12:09:18] ~ Allan: I have asked Khanh for available slots. Hopefully can find a time that works
[2023-03-10, 12:11:22] Evan Donkeys: We used to play on Mondays, maybe it's time to reconsider which day works best for all
[2023-03-10, 12:13:56] ~ Allan: one issue with weeknights is that it seems like Xuan La doesn't have much time - unless we asked to go late like 8pm to 10pm - or we find another location
[2023-03-10, 12:18:53] Evan Donkeys: Yea getting to XL after work for 6pm during rush hour is also very difficult for most
[2023-03-10, 12:20:13] Steve Donkeys: Can we maybe do a 7pm on Monday?
[2023-03-10, 12:40:15] Evan Donkeys: That would work for me
[2023-03-10, 12:40:32] Mathew Russell: Same

[2023-03-10, 12:44:30] Evan Donkeys: They won't do 7-9 eh?
[2023-03-10, 12:44:51] Pat Donkeys: Or 7-10..?
[2023-03-10, 13:04:55] Joe Donkeys: 7-9 would be ideal.
[2023-03-10, 13:05:56] Evan Donkeys: They like they're 2hr time slots :/
[2023-03-10, 13:06:56] ~ Allan: According to VA, only 8-10
[2023-03-10, 13:07:07] ~ Allan: Or maybe 8-11 if we want longer
[2023-03-10, 13:07:40] Mathew Russell: I’d prefer 6pm sundays still if it’s that late haha
[2023-03-10, 13:07:47] Mathew Russell: And maybe mondays as a backup lol
[2023-03-10, 13:08:02] Evan Donkeys: This was the case last time we talked about this as well
[2023-03-10, 13:08:30] Mathew Russell: True
[2023-03-10, 13:08:32] Evan Donkeys: Hard to fit in a trip to the hoi at 10pm

[2023-03-10, 13:17:05] ~ Allan: we can do that - but have to accept that we would find out on a Friday and have to move - which could hurt attendance - will send a poll shortly with available slots and options

[2023-03-10, 13:22:25] Mathew Russell: That’s kinda what I had in mind haha

[2023-03-10, 13:31:53] ~ Allan: can't modify the poll, but will assume votes for Remain on Sunday means this
[2023-03-10, 13:58:45] ~ Allan: Looks like Sunday is the winner, and we can request that if Xuan La has to cancel, it is automatically moved to Monday night
[2023-03-10, 13:58:59] ~ Allan: Of course nothing is automatic but we can try...

[2023-03-10, 18:33:11] ~ Allan: In use I assume since we can't book early
[2023-03-10, 19:07:10] Pat Donkeys: We should all show up for 7:30 to change, stretch and aetuo so we can start the first game no later than 6:10

[2023-03-16, 19:43:25] Pat Donkeys: *HOCKEY GEAR ORDER* 🏒🇺🇸 ✈️ 🇻🇳 😃 

If you need gear now is the time! Please add your order to the Google Sheets shared below *Before Monday March 20*.

Add your name, the name of the product, all specifications (e.g.: size for jocks, shinpads, gloves, etc. or the hand, curve and flex for sticks), plus the link and price of  each product you wish to order.

It takes about 2-3 weeks for the gear to arrive in Hanoi and international shipping costs are approx $10USD per kg but size  also matters (Vinh bait). I'll only be able to share the shipping costs once it arrives in Hanoi.

You can order from *HockeyMonkey.com* and *IceWarehouse.com*.

*Disclaimer:* Vietnamese Customs officers sometime decide to add fees/taxes to certain products, this has only happened once in 7-8 hockey gears orders and it wasn't too bad. And this being Vietnam, there's also an _extremely_ small risk customs decide to punish a freight forwarder by keeping or "losing" an wntire container. This has only happened twice in 20 years over tens of thousands of shipments and the last time was a decade ago. Not a concern but still prefer to put itnout there and make it clear that I won't be able to cover any losses but mine should this happen.

[2023-03-26, 12:50:24] Pat Donkeys: *New setup, warmup and game start rules* 

Gone are the days of us losing 30 minutes of precious playing time!

From now on the following rules will be in effect:

1. No one is allowed to play with a ball before the playing surface is entirely set up and clean.

2. Goalies should be dressed as soon as the court is game-ready. They should not participate in setting up the court in any way and focus on gearing up/stretching.

3. Once the court is ready and the goalies are dressed we will have a 10 minute warm up.

We are aware that this isn't always possible but please try your best to show up 15-20 minutes before to gear up, setup and stretch.

With these adjustments in place we should be dropping the ball no later than 15 minutes after our booking starts and enjoy more playing time.
[2023-03-26, 12:56:54] Michael Harder Donkeys: Thanks Pat for the needed reminder!
[2023-03-26, 12:57:11] Michael Harder Donkeys: Also for cleaning up before sitting down things go so much faster with double the hands.

[2023-03-28, 08:41:55] Stew Donkeys: Lots of good battles last night
[2023-03-28, 08:42:06] Stew Donkeys: Jimmy!
[2023-03-28, 08:42:58] Mathew Russell: Stud in the pipes
[2023-03-28, 09:38:25] Eric Brumm Donkeys: A lot of internal conflict on team black.
[2023-03-28, 09:59:52] Stew Donkeys: We should figure out the rule about shooting before crossing center after a goal
[2023-03-28, 10:36:47] Evan Donkeys: And high sticks 😂
[2023-03-28, 10:37:22] Pat Donkeys: We can just vote on it, we used to allow it until we played at Day La and then we kept it going back to Xuan La
[2023-03-28, 10:43:39] Pat Donkeys: Don't swat the ball at shoulder height, dangerous.
[2023-03-28, 10:45:18] Evan Donkeys: Shoulder is the cutoff, above shoulder is the infraction, especially when a guy is crouching down
[2023-03-28, 10:46:08] Pat Donkeys: I saw that on high, called it
[2023-03-28, 10:46:08] Stew Donkeys: And we're talking about shoulder height of the shorter player 🤪
[2023-03-28, 10:46:18] Evan Donkeys: But we need to decide if the cutoff is different for goals (usually crossbar) and elsewhere (usually shoulder)
[2023-03-28, 10:46:37] ~ Allan: are we talking contact - or the stick going above the shoulder at any time?
[2023-03-28, 10:46:52] Evan Donkeys: This was to swat down a ball
[2023-03-28, 10:46:55] Stew Donkeys: Anytime
[2023-03-28, 10:47:00] Pat Donkeys: The rules for tourney and our Sundays should be different
[2023-03-28, 10:47:19] ~ Allan: how so?
[2023-03-28, 10:47:32] Evan Donkeys: Can't have that since everytime someone wheels their stick it'd be an infraction
[2023-03-28, 10:47:34] Stew Donkeys: Anytime helps to develop a habit of keeping sticks down all the time
[2023-03-28, 10:47:54] Pat Donkeys: My opinion is thst we need tk remove the reflex from our game on Sundays and be strict about all attempts
[2023-03-28, 10:48:02] Evan Donkeys: Gonna call a penalty on a guy mid deke?
[2023-03-28, 10:48:19] Pat Donkeys: Nah just swatting attempts
[2023-03-28, 10:48:25] Pat Donkeys: Hit or miss
[2023-03-28, 10:48:30] Evan Donkeys: That's not all the time then is it
[2023-03-28, 10:49:06] Stew Donkeys: Close enough, but you get the point
[2023-03-28, 10:49:06] Pat Donkeys: I try to yell it out everytime i see it, play doesn't always stop
[2023-03-28, 10:53:51] Alex Barzdenis: This sounds good to me 👍
[2023-03-28, 10:54:07] Mathew Russell: How fired up are we for the tournament tho. I can’t wait

- Set the NHL record for most wins in a season

- Take a 3-1 lead in the first round

- Lose three straight, two of them at home, against a team that had 23 less wins and 43 less points than them, to end the season with three straight losses and a first round exit. 

- Get mocked and memed endlessly after ending a historic season an absolute collapse for the ages. 

How can you not be romantic about chaotic playoff hockey?

[2023-05-09, 08:01:51] Eric Brumm Donkeys: Hehe. I mean I’m pretty sure it’s rigged when they don’t even show the lotto balls anymore
[2023-05-09, 08:03:33] Stew Donkeys: There aren't lotto balls. It's some fucked up mathematical equation that no one can understand so they can easily choose who they want to have win, and no one can say they're wrong
[2023-05-09, 08:04:42] Mathew Russell: Oh really? When did they stop the balls?
[2023-05-09, 08:04:58] Mathew Russell: I thought it was still balls and each team had a number of 4 number combos that result in their win
[2023-05-09, 08:05:45] Eric Brumm Donkeys: Yeah they used to do lotto balls
[2023-05-09, 09:21:57] Alex Barzdenis: This is right
[2023-05-09, 09:22:28] Alex Barzdenis: Would be more fun if they just shoved a bunch of balls with team logos in there though haha
[2023-05-09, 09:23:25] Stew Donkeys: Ya it's right. There are 4 numbers pulled. But why do you need 4 balls?
[2023-05-09, 09:23:50] Stew Donkeys: This makes too much sense for the NHL to use

[2023-05-09, 09:31:15] Eric Brumm Donkeys: Bettman looks guilty in this picture.
[2023-05-09, 09:31:56] Stew Donkeys: Haha yup
[2023-05-09, 09:32:16] Stew Donkeys: But I think he has a resting guilty face haha
[2023-05-09, 12:54:32] ~ Gaz: Definitely rigged. Not showing the balls is suspicious just like Bettman's internal polls he sites everytime someone suggests the NHL ain't doing the right thing. Like the moving board ads that every fan and commentator seems to hate but is loved by all the fans Bettman polls 😂
[2023-05-09, 12:59:50] Alex Barzdenis: They should do the balls live and not just post a video on YouTube after
[2023-05-09, 13:05:04] ~ Gaz: Absolutely I mean I had no horse in this race but for the sake of all fan bases, they really should be as transparent with the lottery as possible.
[2023-05-09, 13:05:50] Eric Brumm Donkeys: yeah same here ;)
[2023-05-09, 13:05:51] Eric Brumm Donkeys: haha

[2023-05-10, 17:30:18] ~ Allan: Guys, just a personal comment, I hope the tempera from last week were caused by the 50C. Even though there some disputed and missed penalties, we are just playing because we enjoy hockey and hopefully enjoy ourselves, last week wasn't enjoyable at times.

As a board member, we are discussing how to deal with penalties and have also received suggestions from players, hopefully this week we can have some rules in place, but they will not cover everything so we need to deal with more conflict calmly.

Finally, I have spoken with a ref who will be here hopefully next year and he is a full time ref and eager to control you animals!
[2023-05-10, 17:32:21] ~ Gaz: Might have been the full moon influencing emotions as well 🌕. Thanks for the proactive steps you've taken Allan. Very much appreciated. Let's have some fun this Sunday  🏒
[2023-05-12, 09:02:14] B-ron Donkeys: Are our rules posted somewhere?? And if there are any new rules implemented by the board before Sunday can you please share them? Thanks to all you guys that spend time and chat about how to make our league and games better. 🙏

[2023-05-12, 10:33:59] B-ron Donkeys: Cheers thanks homeboy
[2023-05-12, 11:44:45] Jeremy Thiessen: only 1 game for Pietrangelo? if you didnt think the NHL was rigged already after the draft.....what a terrible call
[2023-05-12, 11:45:05] Jeremy Thiessen: looks like HBHL isn't the only league with reffing issues 😂
[2023-05-12, 11:52:46] Mathew Russell: And 1 for nurse haha
[2023-05-12, 11:53:34] Mathew Russell: I thought that was dece tbh. 1 playoff is 3 reg season and he has a clean record.  It was a chop and a half but they were giving it too him all game too, took a cross check to the face (not that that makes it excusable haha)
[2023-05-12, 11:54:32] Jeremy Thiessen: haha i'm not biased at all
[2023-05-12, 11:55:26] Jeremy Thiessen: When McDavid attempts to fight someone its probably outrageous
[2023-05-13, 07:28:32] ~ Allan: Morning everyone, the board discussed the penalty issue and we will start tomorrow with the following: the player/team that was fouled calls the penalty - the offender will sit for 1 minute and their team will be shorthanded.

This is not perfect as we don't have a ref, but hopefully this is a step in the right direction. We will start with this and modify as needed, hopefully this alone will bring cooler heads.

Additionally, remember that even though the NHL playoffs are on now, we are playing for nothing but fun! I don't believe anyone has ever intentionally tried to hurt someone, but there has been an obvious decrease in watching out to make sure the other guy doesn't get hurt. 90% of the time I am sure if you trip someone, even your stick getting caught in the feet, you know it - so stop, we don't need to see that as an opening and drive to the net.

We all work or go to school Monday morning, and  no one wants to go hurt, ball bruises are the exception - wear them with pride!
[2023-05-13, 08:25:09] B-ron Donkeys: Good work Board!!
[2023-05-13, 08:25:57] B-ron Donkeys: Just so I’m clear. we weren’t really following the previous “rules”correct??
[2023-05-13, 08:26:18] Pat Donkeys: Nope
[2023-05-13, 08:26:53] Pat Donkeys: They were written just before we stopped having series
[2023-05-13, 08:27:33] Pat Donkeys: Need to be reviewed
[2023-05-13, 08:27:59] B-ron Donkeys: Or Kuba would of had a penalty shot, and Matt should of had a penalty at the end of last game for high stick to the face. From the rules that were posted.
[2023-05-13, 08:28:30] Pat Donkeys: Yeah, but that's all too harsh, imo
[2023-05-13, 08:30:51] B-ron Donkeys: Fair enough
[2023-05-13, 08:47:16] Stew Donkeys: Imo the harshness is what will (should) deter people from taking a penalty, especially late in a game
[2023-05-13, 08:48:12] Stew Donkeys: Thank you board members for taking the time to help resolve this issue. PPs should be a fun change
[2023-05-13, 08:55:16] Pat Donkeys: Normal for it to get a bit more intense in the last couple of minutes but like Allan said, we're all friends and we're self-policing. If you accidentally trip or clip someone the least you can do is stop, apologize and check if they're alright.
[2023-05-13, 09:04:05] Alex Barzdenis: Rules seem good. Let's please not use this to create a stop in the game every couple minutes though haha

[2023-05-13, 09:38:38] Michael Harder Donkeys: Just a reminder for those that don’t know, my father lost an eye playing Sunday afternoon ball hockey. My uncle lost an eye from a puck. When someone calls high-sticking, and it seems only just above the belly button, let’s just smile w/o debating the actual height and play on, “and go create new opportunities”!!
[2023-05-13, 10:10:47] ~ Gaz: Where did you say those construction glasses were sold in Hanoi? The ones that stop a saw blade. I'm gonna upgrade my glasses
[2023-05-13, 10:21:45] Michael Harder Donkeys: Mega Market had Canadian safety glasses in the tools that look a bit sporty!! if they can stop a piece of metal they’re probably better/safer than normal sports glasses! Just over 100k a pair. The DIY shop 2nd floor Aeon mall Ha Dong should also have smtg too.
[2023-05-13, 10:22:56] Michael Harder Donkeys: If I go this afternoon, I might grab a few extras, for anyone that wants a pair!

[2023-05-14, 17:26:10] ~ Adam Archer: Perhaps we can clarify that if a penalty is called the play is dead. If it is decided that it was not a penalty (miss call) there is a faceoff. I called a trip last week and was completely ignored. It wasn't one of the controversial plays.
[2023-05-14, 17:28:14] ~ Adam Archer: Otherwise you call a penalty, you or your team team stops, the other team can ignore and go score on an odd man rush and then dispute the penalty
[2023-05-14, 17:31:04] B-ron Donkeys: Which happened last week and the other team just called  us a bunch of bitchers and whiners
[2023-05-14, 17:43:55] Evan Donkeys: I'd say give a shout and put your arms up as well

[2023-05-22, 17:15:16] B-ron Donkeys: How about one of those goals in the last game @84919935118  had we all crossed back over center ??
[2023-05-22, 17:57:08] Pat Donkeys: We hadn't...
[2023-05-22, 18:11:53] B-ron Donkeys: Yeah figured that’s the type of goal they’d need just to tie us.
[2023-05-22, 18:13:48] B-ron Donkeys: The rule went from not being able to shoot after a goal, to being able to shoot when other team hasn’t gotten back and set up. 🤔
[2023-05-22, 18:18:10] Eric Brumm Donkeys: Multiple rules broken last night I guess.
[2023-05-22, 18:25:11] ~ Jakub: “Well, I don’t agree” :)
[2023-05-22, 18:28:28] ~ Adam Archer: https://youtu.be/sviTzfV-leI?t=4234 If it's this one it seems fine to me as far as us being all back
[2023-05-22, 18:30:04] ~ Adam Archer: We did all go for a change, so we weren't set up, I thought the rule was we all had to be back on our side, so we'll have to be careful with wholesale line changes after a goal
[2023-05-22, 18:33:27] Pat Donkeys: Hehe, if a ref had called I'd have gone to the box (not without arguing) but me hitting the florr is not a penalty.

As for your goal, Stew and Steve were really slow getting back so all good In my book.
[2023-05-22, 18:44:05] Eric Brumm Donkeys: Yeah it was an epic series and fitting to end in a tie.
[2023-05-22, 18:44:55] Eric Brumm Donkeys: We voted Joe as red MVP. Shut the door the final two weeks
[2023-05-22, 19:05:00] B-ron Donkeys: For a guy that never uses WhatsApp, I got a response out of you pretty quick 😆
[2023-05-22, 19:06:02] ~ Jakub: It’s the smartwatch that changed the game for me :p
[2023-05-22, 20:00:17] Alex Barzdenis: Imo the penalty calls just slow the game down and make people annoyed with eachother lol
[2023-05-22, 20:01:54] Alex Barzdenis: Unless it's obvious like the call on Adam, I don't know that calling your own is very a good idea
[2023-05-22, 20:03:11] Alex Barzdenis: Or my stick getting launched half court haha
[2023-05-22, 20:13:06] Pat Donkeys: That should have been a penalty. And yeah it should only be the real obvious and dangerous ones (trips, high sticks with contact, boarding, etc).
[2023-05-22, 20:15:18] Eric Brumm Donkeys: Kuba came up to me after and said -that was a clean check, no?
[2023-05-22, 20:15:53] Eric Brumm Donkeys: I think my response was if body checks were legal it was clean 😆
[2023-05-22, 20:16:00] ~ Adam Archer: Clean check in a bit checking league?
[2023-05-22, 20:16:11] ~ Adam Archer: Agreed
[2023-05-22, 20:16:37] Evan Donkeys: The Czech kiss 😘
[2023-05-22, 20:16:47] Eric Brumm Donkeys: He was out to get you last night with that slapper to the back of the leg and the big hit.
[2023-05-22, 20:17:40] B-ron Donkeys: 1 minute for unsportsmanlike conduct, goodluck
[2023-05-22, 20:18:22] B-ron Donkeys: Are you sure it wasn’t, I didn’t even touch him.
[2023-05-22, 20:20:30] Pat Donkeys: I was shocked no one called that, everyone saw it, shoving the best player's stick 10 meters away clearly gives your team an unfair advantage
[2023-05-22, 20:20:51] B-ron Donkeys: Stew ya??
[2023-05-22, 20:21:18] Evan Donkeys: Up to Alex to call it
[2023-05-22, 20:21:34] Pat Donkeys: Yup
[2023-05-22, 20:22:02] Pat Donkeys: But when it's that obvious anyone should be able to call it imo
[2023-05-22, 20:23:17] B-ron Donkeys: Anyone On the court
[2023-05-22, 20:24:37] Evan Donkeys: Thought it had been decided that it was call your own
[2023-05-22, 20:26:27] ~ Adam Archer: I like the option of calling a faceoff too. If the teams agree it isn't penalty worthy. 

That evens up any chance of advantage for the team going the other way when a player is either down or without a stick.
[2023-05-22, 20:27:07] ~ Adam Archer: Penalty should be if a player was put in a potential injury situation..
[2023-05-22, 20:27:50] Stew Donkeys: With Alex's stick, didn't he dig the ball out of Joe's glove after he caught it?
[2023-05-22, 20:27:51] Pat Donkeys: That makes a whole lot of sense to me
[2023-05-22, 20:28:49] ~ Jakub: Well, I don’t agree
[2023-05-22, 20:28:52] ~ Adam Archer: I remember it that way, or at least he tried, might be hard to see on the footage..
[2023-05-22, 20:29:37] Stew Donkeys: So launching his stock 10m away is better than what should have happened 😂

[2023-05-22, 20:35:17] B-ron Donkeys: You like stats??  Check out 87/88
‎[2023-05-22, 20:35:35] B-ron Donkeys: ‎image omitted
[2023-05-22, 20:40:09] B-ron Donkeys: 30 goals and Almost 400 penalty minutes 😳
[2023-05-22, 20:44:18] B-ron Donkeys: Different time I know, league leader this year was Pat Maroon with 150 and 5 goals
[2023-05-22, 21:03:39] Alex Barzdenis: I seem to remember the ball being loose lol I don't recall any digging. But fair enough, never mess with the goalie
[2023-05-22, 21:04:58] Alex Barzdenis: I just find it's hard to remember in the moment to call on your own and can completely disrupt the play if someone makes a bad call and ruins the other teams scoring chance
[2023-05-22, 21:06:30] Pat Donkeys: So don't make bad calls :)
[2023-05-22, 21:06:42] ~ Jakub: Exactly! Like the Adam’s call!!!
[2023-05-22, 21:07:13] ~ Jakub: I’m sorry @84919935118 ! It was a joke !!!
[2023-05-22, 21:07:40] Alex Barzdenis: It's inevitable
[2023-05-22, 21:09:58] Pat Donkeys: We should call:
A: what ia dangerous 
B: what is flagrant 

If it's a little hold or a little slash that only you see then just keenplayig and take a mental note for later
[2023-05-22, 21:10:42] Pat Donkeys: If Michael had shoved your stick 1-2 meters further, meh, but this was passes the blue line lol
[2023-05-22, 21:10:49] Pat Donkeys: Passed*
[2023-05-22, 21:14:42] Alex Barzdenis: Seems fair
[2023-05-22, 21:14:53] Alex Barzdenis: And at that point, it would pretty much be a group call
[2023-05-22, 21:15:09] Pat Donkeys: Exactly
[2023-05-22, 21:15:20] Mathew Russell: Ya imo a penalty is something blatantly obvious that everyone in the rink can see and agrees is a call
[2023-05-22, 21:18:49] ~ Adam Archer: Not sure we have ever all agreed on anything but that is the ideal situation
[2023-05-22, 21:20:38] Pat Donkeys: Pretty good setup for a burn
[2023-05-22, 21:21:08] Pat Donkeys: And I was probably the most likely victim 😅
[2023-05-22, 21:22:05] ~ Jakub: Unless its a penalty call against Pats team. The whole rink can see it MINUS 1 person <3
[2023-05-22, 21:23:10] Pat Donkeys: See I was right!
[2023-05-22, 21:23:42] Pat Donkeys: In all fairness, I'm pretty I'm the only one to ever attempt calling penalties on my own team, multiple time
[2023-05-22, 21:23:44] Pat Donkeys: S
[2023-05-22, 21:24:17] ~ Jakub: Yes, you’re pretty ;)
[2023-05-22, 21:37:31] Evan Donkeys: Pretty fackin annoying 😂
[2023-05-23, 00:46:15] ~ Allan: Well the one thing we can all agree on is Pat is pretty fackin annoying... And we can agree on what a penalty should be now when we are calm and discussing, but we started this because in the heat of the moment we are not calm and discussing and the penalty is to be a deterrent to stop it getting that bad. IMO if we debate a penalty here now, it is easy, but in the moment we shouldn't, and it shouldn't be only for flagrant and obvious, because the ones we don't call or debate when called could lead to escalation and tempers. I don't want to see penalties getting out of hand or being used as a strategy, but the reality is without a ref, we need to call them ourselves, and if I say I got fouled and the other team says no, then I get pissed and may escalate. And we are right back to where we started. I would rather see a few extra penalties called now and keep the game playable, then see the penalties drop off as we realize they will be called and we become more responsible. 

It is not ideal, but I feel we need this, otherwise penalties will eventually not be called at all and we could end up where we were 2 weeks ago - just my 2 cents
[2023-05-23, 00:48:05] ~ Allan: I just read this again - rambles well 🤔 but then again it is almost 1am and I am up with a coughing toddler. Hope it was understandable...
[2023-05-23, 10:47:38] Pat Donkeys: Seems like you upset someone with your utopian ideology Allan
[2023-05-23, 10:51:02] Jeremy Thiessen: Black's first goal this game was KUBA...i didn't touch it
[2023-05-23, 11:10:30] Pat Donkeys: Didn't Evan get a goal from way out on Sunday?
[2023-05-23, 11:36:37] Jeremy Thiessen: he did....just watched that, I also didn't touch that one
[2023-05-23, 11:36:50] Jeremy Thiessen: Red was giving me all these goals 😂
[2023-05-23, 11:39:02] Jeremy Thiessen: also first goal, second game for black was assisted by Evan, not jack
[2023-05-23, 11:45:29] ~ Jack: I was wondering the same thing, I don’t think I ever recorded a point.
[2023-05-23, 11:50:33] Jeremy Thiessen: you'll get it next time, if you keep playing like you did Game 3
[2023-05-24, 08:42:57] ~ Jakub: Happy birthday @84899132401 !! 🥳🥳🥳🍻

[2023-05-24, 09:20:29] Alex Barzdenis: Happy birthday Chiemi✨🎁🎊🎉
[2023-05-24, 09:21:32] ~ Allan: I think an appropriate birthday present from Joe and the Red team is a hat trick ;)
[2023-05-24, 09:40:06] B-ron Donkeys: She doesn’t need a present for that, she can do on her own.
[2023-05-24, 09:41:13] ~ Jack: Like they always say, a good goal is a gift of its own. 🤷‍♂️
[2023-05-24, 10:01:02] ~ Allan: You are so right

[2023-05-24, 19:59:53] ~ Lee Schneckenberger: Happy Birthday Chiemi.  Looks like it was a good one.
[2023-05-25, 09:54:08] Eric Brumm Donkeys: I guess Florida won the Tkachuk trade
[2023-05-25, 09:59:34] ~ Allan: Unfortunately it looks that way ...
[2023-05-25, 09:59:52] Mathew Russell: Somehow haha
[2023-05-25, 10:00:09] ~ Darren R: For sure. Flames fans knew how good he is, was kind of a damage control trade. 

You watch the dude skate and he looks like an ostrich but it works.
[2023-05-25, 10:00:25] ~ Darren R: What a player he is, still love him
[2023-05-25, 10:00:36] Eric Brumm Donkeys: Yeah- he is clearly a full on superstar.
[2023-05-25, 10:01:03] Eric Brumm Donkeys: and equally important a great leader
[2023-05-25, 10:02:14] ~ Darren R: Yeah, he gets crapped on for being a pest but he’s matured a lot and is a total unicorn. Build a team around players like him.
[2023-05-25, 10:02:30] ~ Darren R: Flames should try to get someone like him
[2023-05-25, 10:04:58] ~ ✌️: In a game of fine margins…
Calgary actually ended the season above Florida in the standings.
Pittsburgh choked against bottom fodders in Chicago and Columbus.
Marchand could have ended Florida’s season with a second to go in game 5.
Yet through all that Matthew Tkachuk (and Bob) stepped up when needed the most.
Them Cats are off to the Final. What a sport.
PS: I’m glad that Tkachuk got outta Calgary. He seems to have grown a lot since moving to SoFlo.
[2023-05-25, 10:05:41] Mathew Russell: Maybe huberdeau will reboot without suter next year
[2023-05-25, 10:05:59] Mathew Russell: Rebound **
[2023-05-26, 09:06:12] Eric Brumm Donkeys: Hey- @84903480772 - Can you bring the saw on Sunday? I need to cut my stick down a bit.
[2023-05-26, 09:06:47] ~ Allan: the stick should be in the locker
[2023-05-26, 09:12:33] Eric Brumm Donkeys: ahh- ok sounds good.
[2023-05-26, 09:12:49] B-ron Donkeys: Looking for a little more stick handling eh?
[2023-05-26, 09:13:16] Eric Brumm Donkeys: haha- I am just trying to change something...ANYTHING
[2023-05-26, 09:14:43] Mathew Russell: Okay forward 😉

[2023-05-30, 16:52:52] B-ron Donkeys: Did passing the ball even cross your mind
[2023-05-30, 16:56:08] Jeremy Thiessen: To who? Tel me
[2023-05-30, 16:57:54] B-ron Donkeys: To yourself ??
[2023-05-30, 16:58:38] Pat Donkeys: No good passing options there... 2 guys in front, get the ball through 👍🏼
[2023-05-30, 16:58:49] Pat Donkeys: You want a rebound though :p
[2023-05-30, 17:00:37] Jeremy Thiessen: This is not about me - btw
[2023-05-30, 17:01:18] Jeremy Thiessen: Allan didn’t give away much
[2023-05-30, 17:01:41] Pat Donkeys: Nope, his glove was 🔥🔥
[2023-05-30, 17:15:32] B-ron Donkeys: Sorry!! It was a joke
[2023-05-30, 17:27:07] ~ Allan: Buying that glove was a worthwhile investment 🤣
[2023-05-30, 17:27:51] B-ron Donkeys: He could of made a better clip with about 5 glove saves
[2023-05-30, 17:28:31] Michael Harder Donkeys: What grove? u mean the black one that smw disappeared yesterday?
[2023-05-30, 17:28:48] Michael Harder Donkeys: It has been lately!!
[2023-05-30, 17:29:35] B-ron Donkeys: @84987078800 has your team told you yet. You are the week 3 goalie??

[2023-05-30, 18:31:43] Eric Brumm Donkeys: I think you’re missing a word in there
[2023-05-30, 18:32:07] Eric Brumm Donkeys: Yeah-no infection either.
[2023-05-30, 18:32:20] Stew Donkeys: Get off our 🤬 bench!
[2023-05-30, 18:32:32] Eric Brumm Donkeys: Way too dramatic though, I def shouldn’t have thrown the stick.
[2023-05-30, 18:32:33] Stew Donkeys: Better?
[2023-05-30, 18:32:38] Eric Brumm Donkeys: Much better

[2023-05-30, 18:47:21] ~ Jakub: Byrons bored and in mood to needle it seems. Perhaps better stop or move the conversation elsewhere :p
[2023-05-30, 18:50:04] B-ron Donkeys: Sooo bored
[2023-05-30, 18:50:26] Eric Brumm Donkeys: Fair enough just make sure you have your tetanus booster.
[2023-05-30, 18:52:26] B-ron Donkeys: Yeah I went for stitches couple months prior and went basically for the tetanus shot
[2023-05-30, 18:54:00] Eric Brumm Donkeys: That’s pretty much why I went. Plus Lee told me I needed them, and he was right last time I needed them.

[2023-05-30, 20:34:35] Stew Donkeys: We were kind too to give our PP2 and PP3 some PP time 😉
[2023-05-30, 20:35:25] Stew Donkeys: But I agree, John was pushed
[2023-05-30, 20:38:05] Eric Brumm Donkeys: Hehe.
[2023-05-31, 09:14:36] Pat Donkeys: Does anyone have a tripod head I could borrow?
[2023-05-31, 09:30:39] ~ Allan: I do
[2023-05-31, 09:32:38] ~ Allan: very kind - but in the future would be nice to not argue while standing over a fallen player ...
[2023-05-31, 09:56:24] ~ John: Yeah. Not my best moment, but please remember I was the one who got shoved while going at speed.
[2023-05-31, 10:07:06] B-ron Donkeys: I feel like the physicality has gone way up and a lot more contact. There’s injuries, head contact, pushing and shoving. arguments. We all have jobs and families to go home too. I’m all for trying to tone it down.  I’m contemplating getting a helmet for ball hockey.

[2023-06-11, 15:28:05] Alex Barzdenis: Let's try to start on time tonight. Last few weeks we've had to cut the last game short because we're starting too late

[2023-06-11, 16:32:51] B-ron Donkeys: Also we are looking  for a new bia hoi i believe, if anyone has any suggestions, 55 food is decent but the beer is shit and they cut us off.
[2023-06-11, 16:37:32] Evan Donkeys: We could actually try the next door spot
[2023-06-11, 16:37:44] Evan Donkeys: But they seem to never have room
[2023-06-11, 16:37:49] B-ron Donkeys: We’ve been trying
[2023-06-11, 16:38:21] B-ron Donkeys: And then we end up at 55, drinking bad beer
[2023-06-11, 16:38:38] Evan Donkeys: Last couple times we couldn't get a table
[2023-06-11, 16:38:52] Evan Donkeys: The nice one down by the lake would be the same issue
[2023-06-11, 16:40:18] B-ron Donkeys: And there always Kuba’s favorite the “black mould bia hoi”
[2023-06-11, 16:43:25] Evan Donkeys: That place is good
[2023-06-11, 16:44:00] B-ron Donkeys: 🤣
[2023-06-11, 16:44:47] B-ron Donkeys: The same place that the food is different every week and they do fill up Aquafina jugs from another bia hoi?
[2023-06-11, 16:50:33] Pat Donkeys: If we're under 8 it should be fine, we could try sending a scout early
[2023-06-11, 16:52:09] Evan Donkeys: It's better than getting cut off
[2023-06-11, 16:52:30] Evan Donkeys: They only get more beer for us when we've finished theirs haha
[2023-06-11, 17:10:02] B-ron Donkeys: No, been there 3 times and they had no beer when we arrived, and we waited for them to come back with water jugs full if beer.  I’d prefer to get cut off these days, than a place that’ll serve us until 3-4 am
[2023-06-11, 17:12:36] B-ron Donkeys: But sure let’s give it a whirl
[2023-06-11, 17:12:52] Pat Donkeys: I ain't going there
[2023-06-11, 17:14:17] Evan Donkeys: Pfft these losers with their "standards" 💁‍♂️
[2023-06-11, 17:14:35] Evan Donkeys: Idc if anything I'd say try the place next to 55
[2023-06-11, 17:15:05] B-ron Donkeys: I agree but we’ve tried for 3-4 weeks. Anyways let’s try again
[2023-06-11, 17:15:21] Evan Donkeys: More importantly I'm heading to the court to set up early so we might fit in 3 games
[2023-06-11, 17:26:29] B-ron Donkeys: I’m on way

[2023-06-12, 01:29:02] B-ron Donkeys: Just for the record I’m out for for a while I’m done!! Many many reasons. I get injured wife doesn’t like, but Mainly I’ve heard that we want to build this league, but others tell me we don’t want to build league. “We want to keep it competitive”  for me, I pay 200k to play in a butt a fuck league, but I’m not good enough to play in the final 2.5 minutes of a period or a game.
[2023-06-12, 01:29:18] B-ron Donkeys: Good luck building this league

[2023-06-12, 13:13:22] Mathew Russell: Apparently scheduled outage until 4pm
[2023-06-12, 16:27:28] ~ Allan: Game 1 up

[2023-06-12, 17:18:26] ~ Gaz: Does anyone know if there is a website or somewhere that says when and where these scheduled outages are? Or does the government just like to surprise us 🤷🏼‍♂️
[2023-06-12, 17:21:05] Mathew Russell: I saw on Facebook it was scheduled but no warning was given haha
[2023-06-12, 17:21:27] Mathew Russell: Apparently there’s a drought with one of the hydro plants so they’re lacking hydro
[2023-06-12, 17:23:04] ~ Gaz: Ya I heard that some of the dams are too low to produce power but a heads up might be helpful 😂
[2023-06-12, 17:26:34] Mathew Russell: Yeah haha
[2023-06-12, 17:40:01] Stew Donkeys: We just got notice that we won't have power from 8 - 4 tomorrow. That's the amount of notice that they're supposed to give
[2023-06-12, 17:46:28] ~ Gaz: How did you get notice?
‎[2023-06-12, 17:49:55] ~ Allan: ‎image omitted
[2023-06-12, 17:50:16] ~ Allan: Yup in Hoa Binh, not enough water and they are walking on the riverbed
[2023-06-12, 17:55:40] Stew Donkeys: From the Zalo chart of the residents and then the building management brought a notice
[2023-06-12, 17:57:23] Pat Donkeys: One of the perks of living in Ba Dinh next to government and military offices is we never get power outages
[2023-06-12, 17:58:31] ~ Gaz: Hasn't affected me yet but was trying to be proactive. My landlord is a bit of a mess so doubtful he'll be providing any notice
[2023-06-12, 18:13:47] Evan Donkeys: We were supposed to have one today but it never happened 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2023-06-12, 18:43:26] Michael Harder Donkeys: All our cafes have been down for many hours now.
[2023-06-12, 18:43:49] Michael Harder Donkeys: NOTICE : On 12/06/2023, the Sunshine City Building suffered a sudden power outage at around 10:30 AM without prior notice from the Bac Tu Liem Power Company.
[2023-06-12, 18:44:00] Michael Harder Donkeys: So, even apartment complexes aren’t getting notified in advance.
[2023-06-12, 18:45:32] Alex Barzdenis: My building has a notice up for 8:00-4:00 tomorrow
[2023-06-12, 18:46:08] Pat Donkeys: Doh, that probably applies for us as well then
[2023-06-12, 19:26:08] Steve Donkeys: We lost power in ParkCity last week for the day. It's happen twice here already in the past couple weeks.
[2023-06-12, 19:26:30] Mathew Russell: Yeah same with me in ba dinh
[2023-06-12, 19:26:56] Mathew Russell: Shit
[2023-06-12, 19:29:11] Michael Harder Donkeys: I’m hearing there isn’t enough water in the main power generating dams. I could see the dry brown banks of Hoa Binh dam from 15-20,000’ while on decent yesterday. PFR.
[2023-06-12, 19:40:00] Michael Harder Donkeys: And for those who haven’t noticed yet, no buildings are lit up (or bridges) anymore with the coloured led light displays. It’s a dark, traditional looking city now.
[2023-06-12, 19:43:17] Evan Donkeys: Maybe they shoulda thought about toning it down before we ran out of power haha
